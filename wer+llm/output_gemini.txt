  explanation: Substitutions were counted for words that changed the intended meaning or crucial information (e.g., rupees 1399 to rupees 1300). Deletions were counted for missing words that affected the overall meaning or user instructions. Insertions were counted when extra words altered the meaning or added unnecessary information.  Phonetically similar words (e.g., myntra/mintra) and semantically equivalent phrases were NOT counted as errors.
  substitution_pairs: [{'reference': '1399', 'hypothesis': '1300'}, {'reference': '1898', 'hypothesis': '1800'}, {'reference': 'munira mandviwala', 'hypothesis': 'bijal roliya'}, {'reference': 'y', 'hypothesis': '1'}, {'reference': 'main', 'hypothesis': 'i am'}, {'reference': 'unless', 'hypothesis': 'let me give you a quick overview of our nano plan it includes a blood test doctor consultation and a session with a senior health coach unless'}]
  deletion_words: ['explaining the impact on your health', 'hen', 'main', 'ray']
  insertion_words: ['please give me a moment to fetch your products', 'however your items will arrive securely packed as per our standard procedures', 'what else', 'something', 'i got it', 'am i speaking with', 'let me give you a quick intro to what we offer']

  Analysis: The substitutions of "rs" to "rupees", while slightly different, maintains the core meaning related to currency and pricing, so it does not affect conversational quality. The extra "were" and "you" are filler words and don't change the meaning.  "and" is a necessary conjunction in the reference text to maintain the semantic meaning of the sentence.
